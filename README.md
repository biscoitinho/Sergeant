**Interactive TUI Directory Navigator for Terminal - "Leave it to the Sarge!"**

Sergeant is a interactive terminal user interface (TUI) for navigating directories and managing files.
Instead of typing `cd` and file manipulation commands, just run `sgt`,
use arrow keys and keyboard shortcuts to navigate, preview, copy, move, and organize your files.
Simple, fast, and elegant.

## 📋 Requirements

- **Ruby** 2.7 or higher (Ruby 3.x recommended)

### System Dependencies

The `curses` gem (installed automatically) requires native libraries:

**macOS:**
```bash
# Usually works out of the box
# If you get errors, install Xcode Command Line Tools:
xcode-select --install

# Recommended: Use Homebrew Ruby instead of system Ruby
brew install ruby
# Add to ~/.zshrc: export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"
```

**Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):**
```bash
sudo apt-get install libncurses-dev ruby-dev
```

**Linux (Fedora/RHEL):**
```bash
sudo dnf install ncurses-devel ruby-devel
```

### Optional Tools
- **glow** - For beautiful markdown preview (`brew install glow` or `go install github.com/charmbracelet/glow@latest`)
- **fzf** - For fuzzy file search (`brew install fzf` or `sudo apt-get install fzf`)
- **Archive tools** - For archive preview: `unzip`, `tar`, `7z`, `unrar` (usually pre-installed on most systems)

## 🚀 Installation

### Install from RubyGems

Once published to RubyGems:

```bash
gem install sergeant
```

### Install from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/biscoitinho/Sergeant.git
cd Sergeant

# Build and install the gem locally
gem build sergeant.gemspec
gem install ./sergeant-1.0.0.gem
```

That's it! The `sgt` command will automatically be added to your PATH.

### Troubleshooting Installation

**If sgt doesn't display anything (shows blank screen):**

This can happen on Arch Linux or other systems using Ruby version managers (mise, rbenv, asdf).

**Recommended fix - Add an alias (simplest):**
```bash
# Add to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
echo 'alias sgt='"'"'ruby "$(which sgt)"'"'"'' >> ~/.bashrc

# Reload your shell:
source ~/.bashrc  # or: source ~/.zshrc

# Now sgt works!
sgt
```

**Alternative - Quick test:**
```bash
# Run with explicit ruby (temporary fix)
ruby $(which sgt)
```
### Development Installation

If you want to work on the gem:

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/biscoitinho/Sergeant.git
cd Sergeant

# Install dependencies
bundle install

# Run directly without installing
bundle exec bin/sgt
```

## 🎮 Usage

### Basic Navigation

```bash
# Start sergeant in current directory
sgt

# Start in specific directory
sgt ~/Documents

# Start at a bookmark
sgt -b projects

# Navigate and select
# Arrow keys or j/k to move up/down
# Enter or l to enter directory
# h to go back
# q to quit and cd to selected directory
```

### Command-Line Options

```bash
# View help and all options
sgt --help

# Show version
sgt --version

# List all bookmarks
sgt --list-bookmarks

# Start at bookmark location
sgt -b [bookmark_name]

# Restore last session (continue from where you left off)
sgt --restore

# Debug mode (show environment info)
sgt --debug

# Disable colors
sgt --no-color
```

### Shell Integration (cd to final directory)

The `--pwd` flag enables powerful shell integration, allowing you to navigate visually in sergeant and have your shell automatically cd to the final location:

```bash
# Quick navigation function
# Add this to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc:
s() {
  local dir=$(sgt --pwd "$@")
  [[ -n "$dir" ]] && cd "$dir"
}

# Usage examples:
s                    # Navigate from current dir, cd to final location
s ~/projects         # Start in projects, cd to where you end up
s -b work            # Start at work bookmark, cd to final location

# Alternative one-liner (no function needed):
cd $(sgt --pwd ~/projects)

# Jump to deeply nested directory visually:
cd $(sgt --pwd /usr/local)
```

**How it works:**
1. Start sergeant with `--pwd` flag
2. Navigate to your desired directory using arrow keys
3. Press `q` to quit
4. Sergeant outputs the final directory path
5. Shell captures it with `$()` and cd's there
